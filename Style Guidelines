NOX-LIB STYLE GUIDELINES


Naming Conventions

    Identifiers are to be written in snake case with the following exceptions
     - Template Parameters are to be written in Pascal Case and preceeded with an underscore
     - Function Parameters must be preceeded with a double underscore
     - Class variables must be preceeded with m_ unless it is a public member variable that 
       is part of the public interface, in which case you can ommit the m_, such as with the
       nox::vec structs
     - Constants must be in all caps. If the constant happenes to be a member variable 
       then it is in all caps except for the preceeding "m_"
     - ABOVE ALL, variables must have descriptive names, including loop variables. 
       You are allowed to shorten the name to a slightly less descriptive name if you 
       provide a descriptive comment. This is useful if the name is used as an index such as
       line 36-37 in tui::display()


Arithmetic Conventions

    Any and all arithmetic that is not trivial to understand must be put into a variable
    before use. If this means making multiple variables to describe complicated 
    arithemtic, so be it.
    A descriptive comment is optional but recommended.
